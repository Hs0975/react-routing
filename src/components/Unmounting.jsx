      <p>The unmounting phase refers to the lifecycle stage when a component is being removed from the DOM (Document Object Model) and is no longer rendered or accessible.

        During this phase, React performs a series of cleanup operations to ensure that the component and its associated resources are properly disposed of.

        The unmounting phase is the last stage in the lifecycle of a React component and occurs when the component is being removed from the DOM tree.</p>
